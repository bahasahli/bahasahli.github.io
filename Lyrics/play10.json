Diddy on St. Clair dancingKellsUsed to ride the RTA$1.50 every meterFood wasn’t guaranteed I stole my meals out of ArabicaSpeakers blasting my own shitBow tie on the jet on my grown shitCourt side at the game with the ownerAnd sell the same arena out when I’m homesickGod damn I'm a foolCouple hundred diamonds in the toothCouple hundred bitches in the poolAnd out of a couple hundred rappers I am the truthThat's why I get a couple hundred when I’m in the boothStill I keep that",
