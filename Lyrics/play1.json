            "line": "I had a dream that the world changedAnd for a minute there was no painInstead of presidents and old sayingsI heard lyrics from Kurt CobainThen I wake up to see the world's illOceans tainted from the oil spillsHow many kids have these wars killed?How many families can't afford bills?I wish that I could let the world knowThat it's okay to let the pain showAnd even though times seem badIt always rains before the rainbowI screamed at the top of my lungsBut my voice couldn't save this homeYou're proud of the guns you holdWhat's left now? Where can we goIn my hood money equals powerAnd in the world money controls everything we believe inI can see we're in our darkest hourCause it feels like the government just as crooked as the policeI spent the weekend catchin' up on the newsA girl committed suicide after she was bullied at schoolCause some dudes told her she wasn't coolBut you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rulesI'm confused, tell me is my life's price worth the jewels?They told me fight night I'm supposed to loseJust cause in hindsight, they don't like my typeWhite boy with some rhythm and blues",
