(Huh?)The definition of greatnessIs in the making you're witnessing the amazingBlame me if you awakenYou've been sleeping too long on the one who was chosen mufuckaYou're probably unaware but I'm here to let you know itTake a listen, shut the fuck up for once and just enjoy it: Real MusicBullshit on the daily? try to avoid itYour life's ass, similar to a toilet huh?You see me living chasing everything I wanted, huh?Forever blunted, ready for whatever coming, huh?The mailman keep the check comingThe cash in keep the 'vette runningStop sign? Bitch I run thatLook at where I hung at,Bunch of Eastside boys on the field, punt thatBall 4 lifeGive me some shrooms for the serotoninMe and the crew living for the momentEverything we wanted is oursPut me in a fast car,Big house with a beach for a backyardStress free cause I ain't trying to live with itThe state of mind that I'm in got me thinking differentI used to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in realityCause you can make it happenAnd I'ma make it happenYou gon' watch me make it happen bet you gon remember meWhen you see me in that fast car,Big house with a beach for a backyardStress free I ain't trying to live with itThe state of mind that I'm in got me thinking differentI used to dream until I realized it wasn't shit in realityCause you can make it happenAnd I'ma make it happenYou gon' watch me make it happenBet they gon remember meBet they gon remember meDamnSo many people got them hating facesLike why you mad at me? Iâ€™m just out here getting facesIrritated with these bitches and their crazy waysWhen all I wanted was some head on a lazy day, damn(Where you been?)On the other side of the map taking naps in first class getting paid to rapPaid off having jobs since the seventh gradeGot laid off ever since I've been self madeSee my homie want to see me winFronted me some bands told me "Youngin go and get it in"He believed in it more than I, So I gotta rideDown to die for my dawgs, yep, EST 4 LifeOpportunity took advantage I gotta manageEven when it's hard, hard times, yea, what would I be without it?The struggle made me tougher, forcing me to hustleMoney in demand, fuck fame ain't nothing but trouble dawgI'm never perfect, I got flaws like a lot of ya'llWho be critizing on the low, hating on ya boyYa'll defensive maybe that's why I offend youWhen I dribble through my legs in the mall when it's time to ballLife on the edge, hope I never fallThough you pray I do, what a shame, but I maintain shooting for the starsLet it bang bitch i'm out of rangeAnd just know I shoot back with my rap name",
